---

## Major Architectural Change: Functional Style

All components refactored from OO to functional style:

### Before (OO):
```zig
var lexer = try Lexer.init(source, allocator);
defer lexer.deinit();
const tokens = try lexer.tokenize();

var parser = try Parser.init(tokens, allocator);
defer parser.deinit();
const program = try parser.parse();
```

### After (Functional):
```zig
const tokens = try tokenize(source, allocator);
const program = try parse(tokens, allocator);
// No deinit needed - arena handles everything
```

**Why:** Simpler, clearer ownership, matches functional language philosophy.

---

## Memory Management Strategy

### Arena Per Execution (Standard Pattern)

```zig
fn attemptRun(source: []const u8) !RunAttempt {
    var arena = ArenaAllocator.init(self.allocator);
    defer arena.deinit();  // Frees everything temporary

    // All temporary data uses arena
    const tokens = try tokenize(source, arena.allocator());
    const program = try parse(tokens, arena.allocator());
    var eval_result = try evaluate(program, arena.allocator(), config);
    defer eval_result.deinit();

    // Copy what needs to survive to permanent memory
    const trace_copy = try self.allocator.alloc(TraceEntry, eval_result.trace.len);
    @memcpy(trace_copy, eval_result.trace);

    return RunAttempt{
        .trace = trace_copy,  // Lives in self.allocator
        .value = eval_result.value,
        // ...
    };
}
```

**Key Pattern:**
- **Arena** = temporary allocations (tokens, AST, eval state)
- **Permanent allocator** = results that outlive execution (traces, values)
- **Copy** between them when needed

---

## Current Implementation

### 1. Lexer (lexer.zig) - Functional

```zig
pub fn tokenize(source: []const u8, allocator: Allocator) ![]Token
```

**Features:**
- Functional style (no state struct with methods)
- Internal `LexState` for tracking position
- Indentation tracking (INDENT/DEDENT tokens)
- All operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `==`, `!=`, `:=`, `|>`, etc.
- String literals with escape sequences
- Comments (`//`)

**Tests:** 4 passing (numbers, assignments, multiplication, strings)

---

### 2. Parser (parser.zig) - Functional

```zig
pub fn parse(tokens: []const Token, allocator: Allocator) !Program
```

**Features:**
- Functional style (no Parser struct)
- Internal `ParseState` for tracking position
- Precedence climbing for binary operators
- Supports: assignments, literals, identifiers, binary expressions (`*`, `/`)

**Current Precedence Chain:**
```
parseAssignment()
  → parseMultiplicative()  ✅ (* /)
    → parsePrimary()       ✅ (literals, identifiers)
```

**Tests:** 1 passing (multiplication in assignment)

---

### 3. Evaluator (evaluator.zig) - Functional

```zig
pub fn evaluate(
    program: Program,
    allocator: Allocator,
    config: EvalConfig,
) !EvaluationResult

pub const EvaluationResult = struct {
    value: Value,
    trace: []const TraceEntry,
    allocator: Allocator,

    pub fn deinit(self: *EvaluationResult) void;
};
```

**Features:**
- Functional style (no Evaluator struct)
- Internal `EvalState` for globals and trace
- Supports: literals, identifiers, assignments, binary operators (`*`, `/`, `+`, `-`)
- Optional trace collection
- Type checking (numbers only for operators)
- Division by zero detection

**Tests:** 5 passing (literals, undefined vars, multiplication, division, trace)

---

### 4. Supervisor (supervisor.zig) - OO Style (Intentional)

```zig
pub const Supervisor = struct {
    allocator: Allocator,
    config: SupervisorConfig,

    pub fn run(self: *Supervisor, source: []const u8) !SupervisionResult;
    fn attemptRun(self: *Supervisor, source: []const u8) !RunAttempt;
};
```

**Why still OO?** Supervisor maintains state (config, allocator) and orchestrates multiple attempts. Makes sense as a stateful object.

**Features:**
- Arena-based execution (temp data freed after each attempt)
- Retry logic (eval errors only, not parse errors)
- Trace copying to permanent memory
- Duration measurement
- Success/failure status tracking

**Tests:** 6 passing (success, eval error, parse error, retries, multiplication)

---

## What Works Right Now

### Complete Pipeline

```ripple
result := 3 * 4
```

**Execution flow:**
1. **Tokenize:** `IDENTIFIER`, `COLON_EQUAL`, `NUMBER`, `STAR`, `NUMBER`, `EOF`
2. **Parse:** `Assignment{ name: "result", value: Binary{ STAR, 3, 4 } }`
3. **Evaluate:** `12.0`
4. **Supervise:** Success on first attempt, trace collected

**All memory properly managed, zero leaks.**

---

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Functional vs OO

**Functional (lexer, parser, evaluator):**
- ✅ Simple operations (input → output)
- ✅ No persistent state needed
- ✅ Easier to test (pure functions)

**OO (supervisor):**
- ✅ Stateful orchestration
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Multiple method coordination

### 2. Arena for Temporary, GPA for Permanent

**Why:**
- Temporary data (tokens, AST) dies together → arena perfect
- Permanent data (traces, results) lives longer → explicit allocation
- Clear separation of lifetimes
- No manual cleanup of temporaries

### 3. Trace Ownership

**Pattern:**
```zig
// Evaluator allocates trace in arena
var eval_result = try evaluate(program, arena.allocator(), config);
defer eval_result.deinit();  // Frees trace in arena

// Supervisor copies to permanent memory
const trace_copy = try self.allocator.alloc(TraceEntry, eval_result.trace.len);
@memcpy(trace_copy, eval_result.trace);
```

**Caller owns returned memory, must free it.**

### 4. Program/Expr Keep deinit Methods

**Why:**
- Flexibility for non-arena usage (REPL, caching, hot-reload)
- Calling `deinit()` with arena is harmless (no-op)
- Future-proof for features we haven't designed yet
- User experience > implementation simplicity

**Pattern:**
```zig
var arena = ArenaAllocator.init(allocator);
defer arena.deinit();

var program = try parse(tokens, arena.allocator());
defer program.deinit();  // Harmless with arena, required without
```

---

## Testing Pattern (Standardized)

```zig
test "feature name" {
    const allocator = testing.allocator;
    var arena = std.heap.ArenaAllocator.init(allocator);
    defer arena.deinit();  // Only cleanup needed

    const tokens = try tokenize(source, arena.allocator());
    var program = try parse(tokens, arena.allocator());
    defer program.deinit();  // Explicit, even though arena handles it

    var result = try evaluate(program, arena.allocator(), .{});
    defer result.deinit();

    try testing.expectEqual(expected, result.value);
}
```

**All tests passing, zero memory leaks.**

---

## What's Next

### Immediate: Add More Binary Operators

**Current:** `*`, `/` (multiplication, division)
**Next:** `+`, `-` (addition, subtraction)

**Parser needs:**
```zig
fn parseAdditive(state: *ParseState, allocator: Allocator) !Expr {
    var left = try parseMultiplicative(state, allocator);

    while (state.peek().type == .PLUS or state.peek().type == .MINUS) {
        const op = state.consume();
        const right = try parseMultiplicative(state, allocator);
        // Build binary node
    }

    return left;
}
```

**Then update precedence chain:**
```
parseAssignment()
  → parseAdditive()        ← NEW
    → parseMultiplicative()
      → parsePrimary()
```

### Future Features (In Order)

1. **Addition/Subtraction** (`+`, `-`)
2. **Comparison operators** (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`)
3. **Function calls** (`process(data, config)`)
4. **Lambda expressions** (`|x| -> x * 2`)
5. **Pipeline operator** (`|>`)
6. **Match expressions** (pattern matching)

## Lessons from Refactoring Session

### What Went Well
1. ✅ Functional style is cleaner for pure operations
2. ✅ Arena pattern simplifies memory management dramatically
3. ✅ All tests still pass after major refactor
4. ✅ Zero memory leaks maintained throughout

### What Was Confusing
1. ❌ When to use arena vs manual allocation (now clear)
2. ❌ Ownership of traces and results (now documented)
3. ❌ Whether to keep deinit methods (decided: keep for flexibility)
4. ❌ OO vs functional tradeoffs (now understood)

### Key Insight
**"The runtime is a binary, not a library" doesn't mean "only one allocation strategy."**

Even internal code benefits from flexibility. Keep `deinit()` methods for:
- Future features (REPL, caching, hot-reload)
- Explicit ownership (clear who frees what)
- Harmless with arena (calling deinit is a no-op)

## Architecture Summary

```
User Code
  ↓
Supervisor (OO, stateful)
  ↓ per execution
Arena (temporary allocations)
  ├─ tokenize() → []Token
  ├─ parse() → Program
  └─ evaluate() → EvaluationResult
       ↓ copy trace
Permanent Memory (GPA)
  └─ SupervisionResult (traces, values)
```

**Simple. Clean. Working.**

## Language Features (Current)

### Working Now
```ripple
x := 10                    # Inferred assignment
name: string = "alice"     # Explicit type
result := 3 * 4            # Multiplication
quotient := 10 / 2         # Division
y := x                     # Identifier lookup
```

### Coming Soon
```ripple
sum := 2 + 3               # Addition
diff := 10 - 5             # Subtraction
equal := x == y            # Comparison
double := |x| -> x * 2     # Lambda
result := data |> process  # Pipeline
```

---

**Current Quality: 8.5/10**

**What's good:**
- ✅ Functional architecture matches language philosophy
- ✅ Arena pattern simplifies memory management
- ✅ All tests passing, no leaks
- ✅ Binary operators work (multiplication, division)
- ✅ Clean separation: temporary vs permanent memory

**What's next:**
- Add more operators (`+`, `-`, comparisons)
- Then functions, lambdas, pipelines, match
- Type checker
- Better error messages with source locations

**The foundation is solid. Time to build features.**
